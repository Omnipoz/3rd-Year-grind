print ("Using double quote.") #everycharacter inside double quotes is a string value in python.
print('Using single quote.') # We can use single quote too.
#print('what's up')  
# Due to cases like above double quotes are more preferred when single quote are in sentence to print and vice versa.
print("What's up.")
print('They said,"We are fine."') 

#print('What's up')                 ERROR After "What" the single quote closes the initial single quote and the remaining is not considered string.
#print("They said,"We are fine"")   ERROR  Same problem as above but due to double quote
